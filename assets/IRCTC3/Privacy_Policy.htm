  <p class="BodyText" data-sourcepos="11:1-11:359">IRCTC is dedicated to maintaining the trust and confidence of visitors to its website (www.irctc.co.in) and mobile applications. Users are permitted to access and download information or materials from these platforms solely for personal and non-commercial purposes. Any unauthorized or illegal use of the website or mobile application is strictly prohibited.</p>
  <h3 data-sourcepos="13:1-13:32" id="._social_media"><strong>3. Social Media Integration:</strong></h3>
  <p class="BodyText" data-sourcepos="15:1-15:419">The IRCTC eTicketing platform may utilize social media networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to disseminate information and videos for the enhanced convenience of commuters and the general public. IRCTC assumes no responsibility and shall not be liable for any errors or inconveniences encountered while browsing these social media platforms, or for any objections raised by the hosting organizations/agencies at any time.</p>
  <h3 data-sourcepos="17:1-17:31" id="._site_visit_d"><strong>4. Site Visit Data Logging:</strong></h3>
  <p class="BodyText" data-sourcepos="19:1-19:291">This website and mobile application record user visits and log the following information for statistical analysis: IP address, browser type, operating system type, access date and time, accessed webpages, and downloaded files. This data may be utilized to analyze aggregate traffic patterns.</p>
  <p class="BodyText" data-sourcepos="21:1-21:207">The IRCTC eTicketing website and mobile applications do not automatically capture specific personal information (such as name, phone number, or email address) that would allow individual user identification.</p>
  <h3 data-sourcepos="23:1-23:22" id="._use_of_cooki"><strong>5. Use of Cookies:</strong></h3>
  <p class="BodyText" data-sourcepos="25:1-25:296">This site employs cookies to personalize the user experience and ensure effective website functionality. Cookies are utilized to identify user interests in IRCTC products and to track the efficacy of advertising campaigns. This process does not involve the collection of any personal information.</p>
  <h3 data-sourcepos="27:1-27:33" id="._browser_cook"><strong>6. Browser Cookie Management:</strong></h3>
  <p class="BodyText" data-sourcepos="29:1-29:418">Most web browsers provide users with the ability to view, delete cookies on an individual or website basis, or block cookies from specific or all websites. Cookies can enhance user convenience by automatically logging users in (requiring only password entry). IRCTC may also use cookies to display advertisements or send targeted offers (via email, provided users have not opted out) based on potential user interests.</p>
  <p class="BodyText" data-sourcepos="31:1-31:277">Users should be aware that deleting cookies will result in the loss of any customized preferences, including opt-out preferences for cookies, as this function relies on the presence of an opt-out cookie.

  <p class="BodyText" data-sourcepos="35:1-35:612">Each access to the IRCTC eTicketing website or mobile applications results in the logging of session data. This data may include the user&#39;s IP address, operating system, browser software type, and user activities performed on the platform. Session data is collected to analyze user behavior, browsing patterns (including visit frequency and duration), diagnose server issues, and improve system administration. This information does not personally identify individual users; however, it may be possible to determine a user&#39;s Internet Service Provider (ISP) and approximate geographic location based on this data.</p>
  <h3 data-sourcepos="37:1-37:42" id="._links_to_ext"><strong>8. Links to External Websites/Portals:</strong></h3>
  <p class="BodyText" data-sourcepos="39:1-39:738">The IRCTC eTicketing website and mobile applications may contain hyperlinks to external websites or portals. These links are provided for user information and convenience. Upon selecting a link to an external portal, users will leave the IRCTC platform and become subject to the privacy and security policies of the external website&#39;s owners/sponsors. IRCTC is not responsible for the content and reliability of these linked websites and does not necessarily endorse the views expressed therein. The presence of a link on the IRCTC website or mobile application should not be interpreted as an endorsement of any kind.
